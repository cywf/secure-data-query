# Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC): SMPC enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their private inputs without sharing the raw data. Each party contributes its data, and the computation is performed in a collaborative and secure manner, ensuring that no party can learn the individual inputs of others.

# Using PySyft library for SMPC
import torch
import syft as sy

# Create a couple of workers
alice = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="alice")
bob = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="bob")

# Original data
data = torch.tensor([5.])

# Share the data among the workers
shared_data = data.share(alice, bob)

# Perform computation on shared data
result_shared = shared_data + torch.tensor([7.]).share(alice, bob)

# Get the result back
result = result_shared.get()

print(result)  # Output: tensor([12.])
